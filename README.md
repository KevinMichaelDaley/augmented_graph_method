This is an implementation of the (augmented) connection graph method for determining synchronization conditions of diffusively-coupled (directed) networks.  
It includes a graph routing algorithm which minimizes the sum of path lengths through the most travelled edge of a given network in polynomial time (a prerequisite to the optimal implementation of such methods).

For more information, see our paper (currently under review; link will go here).
You may use this code for any purpose; however, we kindly ask that you cite the above paper.
